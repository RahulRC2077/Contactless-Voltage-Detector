## Principle : 
ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION: Electromagnetic or magnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field.

Faraday's law of induction makes use of the magnetic flux ΦB through a region of space enclosed by a wire loop. The magnetic flux is defined by a surface integral:

## Working :
When an AC/DC Power Supply Source is moved near to the Antenna of the circuit. There is a small current induced in the coil by Electromagnetic Induction. This current is amplified using the circuit to light up an LED or even a Buzzer.

## Applications : 
1. Detect any small amount of Voltage present in a wire
2. Useful while handling many live wires.
